# Memory Game 📖

This project was developed during the TQI Fullstack Developer bootcamp on 
the Digital innovation one platform. The initial project was
the memory game made with vanilhajs and with super mario theme,
it contained only one page, in which the cards were presented for a certain time and
then they all turn, from there you have to find the cards that correspond by clicking on they.

The project developed in this repository was made with Reactjs with the theme of the 
One Piece anime. This project contains a page, but with three screen components, one 
to start the game, one for the game and the last one for the end of the game with the
option to reset the game.

You may also notice that upon restarting the game the characters on the cards change.

## What I learned 🧑‍💻

I learned how to install and use the tsparticles tool to generate animations,
which I used to generate the confetti in the endgame component. I also learned
to add data to html tags with the data attribute, and get that data with typescript.
